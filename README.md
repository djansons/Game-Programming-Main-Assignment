# Game-Programming-Main-Assignment

I wrote this game in my second year of Uni in the Game Programming Techniques unit. 
It uses the XNA framework/Monogame and open an source library created by the unit convener Rob Cox. I had to modify some of the library functions so they would accept the required arguments. 
This was my first large project written in a OO language. The hardest part of the project was calculating when to make an enemy fire a missile, so that it would bounce off walls and objects and hit the player. 
If played, be sure to press the 'b' key to display trajectories and bounding boxes.
